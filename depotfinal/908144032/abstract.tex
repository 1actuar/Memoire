  Classical models in finance are based on a set of hypotheses that are not always empirically verifiable. The main objective behind this master's thesis is to show that the generalized asymmetric Laplace distribution is an interesting alternative to those models. To support this idea, we focus on some of its properties to develop parametric estimation, approximation and testing methods, then we work out some principles of derivatives pricing. Finally, we have a numerical example to illustrate these concepts.
